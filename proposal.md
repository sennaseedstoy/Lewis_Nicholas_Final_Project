# Soundboar

## Repository
https://github.com/sennaseedstoy/Lewis_Nicholas_Final_Project.git

## Description:
I want to make a soundboard that will allow you to import audio files (or video files and it would take the audio from them). This would hopefully provide an easy free way to combine audio files or have silly sound effects in videos or even voice calls.

## Features
- Soundboard
	- Open files, and play them when buttons or keys are pressed.
- Play sounds
	- Make the sounds able to play in other applications when the program is running.
- Record
	- Allow sounds from the soundboard to be played over another file.

## Challenges
- I would need to learn how to open and play audio files.
- I would like to add clickable buttons on screen that would play the sounds.
- I have to figure out how to get the sounds to be heard in an external program like discord or obs.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome would be different types of audio files could be opened and edited, and then played with keys or on screen buttons and be audible in an external program.
Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Audio files can be played with keys, the sounds can be recorded to a new file.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Set up project
  2. Get it to open audio files (at least mp3s, preferably multiple types).
  3. Start UI
  4. Get it to record the sounds into a new file

- Week 2
  1. Continue work on UI (make it good enough in case I don't have time next week)
  2. Set up keybinds
  3. Set up buttons that can be clicked to play audio.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Troubleshoot (I WILL have broken something by now)
  2. Find out how to ensure audio played is recorded by external software.
  3. Finalize UI (Do this last in case I run out of time)
